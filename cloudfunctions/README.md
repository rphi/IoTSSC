# AirSense FireBase bits

There's some cloud functions in `functions`, and the website in `hosting`.

You'll need `firebase-tools` in your `npm` global, and that only likes Node version 8 (so `nvm install 8 && nvm use 8`)

The website uses Vue and its `@vue/cli` needs Node v10 or later, so `nvm use default` to make that work.
